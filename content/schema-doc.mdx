summary: "About my new documentation cum blog template schemadoc"
---

I made a documentation template named Schema doc which is more enhanced, future designed, and comes with latest technologies like Nextjs, TailwindCSS, React (common for my projects), MDX and Radix Ul. 

It is made to make users/clients who focus on content and Site Details instead of Ul and other layouts of documentation site (as same like docasaurus but more enhanced than that). 

I made this documentation under [LISA Org. (Libraries and Indexed Software Assets)](https://lisaorg.vercel.app/) but personally designed by me. Github: [click here](https://github.com/lisaorg/schemadoc)

Docs Deployment: [click here](https://schemadoc.vercel.app)

CLI command: 

```bash
npx schemadoc@latest
```

Happy Coding.
